# move-to-next-monitor

Script to move windows from one monitor to the next in Xubuntu

Even though I don't use Xubuntu anymore, people are still interested
in this script. Sweet! Glad it can help others.

I mapped `ctrl+alt+n` to exectute this script.

## Support

Since I don't use Xubuntu and therefore don't have a way to test changes, I'm going to rely on others to QA and give me feedback.

## Thanks
